# TTS_DND

-- User interface:

-- 0) spawn in object / code for GUI from workshop 

-- 1) GM ONLY - enter the server's exteral ip address (safer not to automate this) 

-- 2) display list of PCs (in the future, we can let players add characters and maybe even pictures) 

-- 3) Players - choose your player. asscociated with your tabletop color (when a player is selected, add to map). 

-- 4) GM ONLY - 'request initiative' button. asks each player for their initiaitve total. 

-- 5) Players - enter your initiative total (GM should already have your dex in the server in case of ties). 

  -- 5.5) Once all player initiative totals are collected, GM can roll init (display what is entered to the GM). 

-- 6) Display turn order 

-- 7) On a player's turn, they can end their turn, advancing to the next player ('your turn' notification?). 
  -- 7.5) GM can end any turn. 

-- 8) GM can also refresh turn order 

-- 9) GM can request a party skill check (like initiative, but just displays results)


-- Upcoming functions: 

-- add funtion to 'reveal' enemy attacks, weakneses or reactions! 

-> possibly add recursion / dynamic render a scrollable list of initOrder?
